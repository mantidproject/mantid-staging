Wall-clock timers
------------------------
Wall-clock time is the `total` time elapsed during execution of code instructions. Mantid wall-clock timer classes
are based on the `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/high_resolution_clock>`__ class.

.. _Timer:

Class Timer
~~~~~~~~~~~

`MantidKernel/Timer <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/main/Framework/Kernel/inc/MantidKernel/Timer.h>`__
works like a stop-watch. You need to instantiate it before the code being profiled begins and then output its elapsed time right
after the code ends. You can also reset the timer between time measurements, if necessary. An example is given below.

.. code-block:: cpp


    Mantid::Kernel::Timer timer;
    // do something that takes 5 sec
    std::cout << "did step 1 in " << timer << "\n";
    // do something else that takes 55 sec - the timer still accumulates
    std::cout << "did step 2 after " << timer << " from start\n";
    timer.reset(); // reset the timer to zero
    // do something else that takes 5 sec
    std::cout << "step 3 took " << timer << "\n";

    Output:
    did step 1 in 5 sec
    did step 2 after 60 sec
    step 3 took 5 sec

.. _CodeBlockTimer:

Class CodeBlockTimer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MantidKernel/CodeBlockTimer <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/main/Framework/Kernel/inc/MantidKernel/Timer.h>`__ is
designed for timing a block of C++ code inside curly braces, i.e. inside a scope. You just need to instantiate
a timer object on the stack at the start of the scope and provide an output stream. When the timer goes out of scope,
it automatically outputs the elapsed time to the stream. An example is given below.

.. code-block:: cpp

    #include "Timer.h"
    void MyAlgorithm::doSomething()
    {
        // Instantiate a timer object on the stack. Specify the name and output stream.
        Mantid::Kernel::CodeBlockTimer timer("MyAlgorithm::doSomething", std::cout);
        // Do something that takes 5 sec
        // ...
        //
        // When the timer goes out of scope, it will output the results
    }

    Output: Elapsed time (sec) in "MyAlgorithm::doSomething": 5

The above example shows how to time a whole function. You can, however, break a function into smaller blocks of code using curly
braces and time each code block separately. Note, when a code block is executed multiple times, `CodeBlockTimer` will output the elapsed
time for each execution. If you don't want to have multiple lines of output and are interested in the total elapsed time, use :ref:`CodeBlockMultipleTimer <CodeBlockMultipleTimer>`.

.. _CodeBlockMultipleTimer:

Class CodeBlockMultipleTimer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MantidKernel/CodeBlockMultipleTimer <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/main/Framework/Kernel/inc/MantidKernel/Timer.h>`__ is designed
for timing a block of code that is called multiple times. Similar to :ref:`CodeBlockTimer <CodeBlockTimer>`, it needs to be instantiated on the stack at the
start of the scope. The constructor takes in a `MantidKernel/CodeBlockMultipleTimer::TimeAccumulator <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/main/Framework/Kernel/inc/MantidKernel/Timer.h>`__
object. Unlike the timer, which gets destroyed at the end of the scope, the time accumulator has to be persistent. One possibility is to declare it
with a static linkage in the same compilation unit and provide an accessor function. Every time the timer goes out of scope, it automatically updates the time accumulator.
The time accumulator can later be accessed to report the total elapsed time. In the example below Algorithm B calls a method on Algorithm A several times and outputs the total time elapsed in that method.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // File MyAlgorithm_A.cpp
    #include "Timer.h"
    // Declare a time accumulator with a static linkage
    static Mantid::Kernel::CodeBlockMultipleTimer::TimeAccumulator s_timeAccumulator("MyAlgorithm_A::doSomething");
    // Provide an accessor function
    MANTID_KERNEL_DLL const Mantid::Kernel::CodeBlockMultipleTimer::TimeAccumulator& myAlgorithm_A_TimeAccumulator(){
        return s_timeAccumulator;
    }
    // ...
    void MyAlgorithm_A::doSomething(){
        // Declare a timer object on the stack. Specify the time accumulator.
        Mantid::Kernel::CodeBlockMultipleTimer timer(s_timeAccumulator);
        // Do something that takes 5 sec
        // ...
        //
        // When the timer goes out of scope, it will update the time accumulator
    }

    // File MyAlgorithm_B.cpp
    #include "Timer.h"
    // Let the linker know that the accessor function for the time accumulator is defined in another compilation unit
    extern const Mantid::Kernel::CodeBlockMultipleTimer::TimeAccumulator& myAlgorithm_A_TimeAccumulator();

    void MyAlgorithm_B::doSomething(){
        // Call MyAlgorithm_A::doSomething() 3 times
        // ...
        //
        // Output the results
        std::cout << myAlgorithm_A_TimeAccumulator() << '\n';
    }

    Output: Elapsed time (sec) in "MyAlgorithm_A::doSomething": 15; Number of entrances: 3


CPU timers
----------

CPU time is the time spent by the CPU while processing code instructions. Unlike wall-clock time, CPU time does not include
time spent waiting for disk, network or other resources, e.g. I/O operations.

Class CPUTimer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MantidKernel/CPUTimer <https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/blob/main/Framework/Kernel/inc/MantidKernel/CPUTimer.h>`__
measures both CPU time and wall-clock time. The CPU time measurement utilizes
`std::clock() <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/c/clock>`__ function. The wall-clock time measurement uses :ref:`Timer <Timer>` class.
The output includes the wall-clock time and the ratio of the CPU time to the wall-clock time. Note, since CPU time and wall-clock time are measured
with different accuracy, it is possible to have a ratio greater than 1.
A code example is given below.

.. code-block:: cpp


    Mantid::Kernel::CPUTimer timer;
    // do something that takes 5 sec
    std::cout << "did step 1 in " << timer << "\n";
    // do something else that takes 55 sec - the timer still accumulates
    std::cout << "did step 2 after " << timer << " from start\n";
    timer.reset(); // reset the timer to zero
    // do something else that takes 5 sec
    std::cout << "step 3 took " << timer << "\n";

    Output:
    did step 1 in  5.0000 sec, CPU Fraction 1.00
    did step 2 after 60.0000 sec, CPU Fraction 0.99
    step 3 took  5.0000 sec, CPU Fraction 1.00
