Sample Transmission Calculator Testing
======================================

Introduction
------------

This is a manual testing guide for the :ref:`sample_transmission_calculator` (Interfaces > General > Sample Transmission Calculator).

Basic Usage
-----------

1. For the Input Wavelength Range at the top of the window select ``Single`` from ``Type`` dropdown box and set

  - ``Low=1.8``
  - ``Width=1``
  - ``High=7.8``

2. In sample details set

  - ``Chemical Formula = V``
  - ``Mass Density = 6``
  - ``Thickness = 0.5``

3. Click ``Calculate`` button in bottom right - it should produce the following

4. Select ``Number Density`` instead of ``Mass Density`` in the sample details and set ``Number Density = 0.072`` (it should produce an near identical result with transmission ~0.65 at the lowest wavelength).


Multiple atoms in chemical formula
----------------------------------

1. In sample details set

  - ``Chemical Formula = C2 H4``
  - ``Mass Density = 0.93``
  - ``Thickness = 0.015``

2. Click ``Calculate`` - the transmission should be ~0.9 for all wavelengths (the cross-section is dominated by incoherent scattering rather than absorption - only the latter depends on wavelength).

3. Set ``Chemical Formula = C4 H8`` and click ``Calculate`` - the result should not change.
   This doubles the number of scatterers in a formula unit, but because the mass density is the same it halves the number of formula units in the sample volume.

4. Select ``Number Density`` instead of ``Mass Density`` in the sample details and set ``Number Density = 0.12`` (it should produce an near identical result with transmission ~0.9 at the lowest wavelength).
   This is because the units of ``Number Density`` are ``atoms/Ang^3`` not ``formula units/Ang^3``.

5. Set ``Chemical Formula = C2 D4`` and ``Calculate`` - the transmission should be ~1 (deuterium has a much smaller incoherent cross-section than hydrogen).

.. _sample_transmission_wavelength_validation:

Validation of Single Wavelength Range
-------------------------------------

For each of the following instructions there should be a warning message in red at the bottom of the window.

1. Try setting ``Low > High``

2. Try setting ``Width > (High - Low)``

3. Try setting ``Width = 0``


It should not allow you to input the following in the spin-boxes (no warning will be printed).

1. Negative numbers

2. Punctuation

3. Non-numeric characters (including punctuation)

If you delete the contents of a box and then click ``Calculate`` it will reset it with the previously entered values.


Multiple Wavelength Range
-------------------------

1. For the Input Wavelength Range at the top of the window select ``Multiple`` from ``Type`` dropdown box

2. In the ``Multiple`` edit box enter ``1,1,3`` and click ``Calculate``

3. Right-click on the  ``transmission_ws`` workspace in the main workbench window and ``Show Data`` - you should see that there are 2 bins at wavelengths ``1.5 Ang`` and ``2.5 Ang``

4. In the ``Multiple`` edit box enter ``1,1,3,0.5,4`` and click ``Calculate`` - in the workspace data table you should see additional bins at ``3.25 Ang`` and ``3.75 Ang``

5. Repeat the validation tests in :ref:`sample_transmission_wavelength_validation`

Chemical Formula Validation
---------------------------

The following should produce a warning at the bottom of the window and throw an error from :ref:`CalculateSampleTransmission
<algm-CalculateSampleTransmission>`

1. Set ``Chemical Formula = C2H4`` (i.e. remove the space)

2. Set ``Chemical Formula = Z``

3. Set ``Chemical Formula = 0``

4. Set ``Chemical Formula = *``

5. Set ``Chemical Formula = 2C 4H``
