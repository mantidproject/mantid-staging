A selection table with various scattering channels of reduced data is
provided on the left side. The user can select which channels should
be visualized. With the up and down arrows, one can move through each
available single channel. The **Raw** button selects for visualization
all the scattering channels chosen by the user in the **Sample Data**
view of the :ref:`Data <dns_powder_tof_data_tab-ref>` tab. The **Sep**
button selects the workspaces with separated nuclear coherent,
spin-incoherent, and magnetic contributions. The latter contribution is
available when the :math:`xyz`-separation option is selected by the user.

The dropdown :math:`2 \theta` box can be used to switch the labels of the
:math:`x`-axis between the scattering angle :math:`2 \theta`, scattering vector
`q`, and spacing :math:`d`. The **log** checkbox can be used to switch to the
logarithmic :math:`y`-axis scaling. The buttons to the right from it can be
used to change grids, line styles, and error bars.
